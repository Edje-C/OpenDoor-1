# OpenDoor
Open Door was a hackthon project where we wre required to used to on the NYC Open Data API's.

We decided to use the Health Code violations API.

The idea behind our project is, when searching for apartments there's more than what's at face value and we'd like to equipt renters with the knowlodge they need to make the right decision for themselves.

Often times viewing an apartment doesn't accurately let you know what it's like to live there. There may be issues with the heating or a rat infestation, these are things you wouldn't know until after moving in.

We aim to solve this issue by giving tenants a platform to review their apartments.

        review: "We moved into The Wimbledon in 2013 and initially truly loved the building! Unfortunately, the new management company Rose Associates has been horrible. First the good: Great location with circular driveway for loading/unloading (invaluable with kids), (new appliances/nice bathrooms), wonderful doormen/super/maintenance staff. The bad: Endless construction on the roof deck with scaffolding and noise. It has now taken over a year to 'renovate' though it was perfectly nice and functional prior. Minimal communication from the management in regards to construction timelines and no rent deduction for loss of use of this amenity. The gym is filthy with barely functional machines. Management does not care of their tenants and is reflected by large turnover and apartment availability. Do yourself a favor and rent elsewhere. For the outrageous high rent they charge, this is not a luxury building. ",

        review: "Moved in part-way through 2013. I like the building, the location and the floorplan, but the rent is higher than what I saw for other 2BR/2BA apartments on the UES. New management company took over in late 2013 and is much better than the prior management company. ",

        review: "Have been living in this apartment building for many years and overall, the building is a nice place to live. Good location to access public transportation, shopping and restaurants. Under relatively new management and this company is extremely accessible and very hands on with the services/personnel in the building. Building common areas are well maintained. Apartment personnel are attentive, but sometimes lack direction. Unfortunately, not all tenants living in this building are considerate of their fellow renters, but I would surmise that this building is no different than other rentals. I would recommend this building as a place to live as long as the management company remains here. They are a big plus to the building. ",

        review: " I moved in a little over a year ago under the former management company, who promised me several things in my unit. I was very upset when asking several times, they did not take care of items. We have a new company that came in over the summer and they have been great! They have taken care of all my reasonable concerns. They had a few events and they were a great way to make the building feel like a community. I have had such a good experience that I just renewed for another year. ",
